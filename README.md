# Yet Another Printer (Yap)

**Yap** is a lightweight, configurable logging package for Go â€” with support for timestamps, caller info, severity levels, and colorful/styled output.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ•’ Optional timestamps
- ðŸ“‚ Caller file + line number
- ðŸ”§ Function name tracing
- ðŸŽ¨ Severity colors, styles and symbols
- âš¡ Simple API (`yap.Info("...")`)

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
go get github.com/jflorberg/yap
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Initialize the logger with configuration and set it as the default:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/jflorberg/yap"
)

func init() {
	cfg := &yap.Config{
		UseTimestamp:      true,
		UseCallerFile:     true,
		UseCalledFunc:     true,
		UseSeverityColors: true,
		UseSeverityStyles: true,
	}
	log := yap.New(cfg)
	yap.SetDefault(log)
}

func main() {
	yap.Info("App started")
	yap.Warning("This is a warning")
	yap.Error("Something went wrong")
}
```

## ðŸ“– Background

The reason I created this logger was not only to try something new and publish my first Go package, but also because I was tired of using log packages that were difficult to customize and made terminal logs hard to read.

I prefer using colors and severity levels to get a quicker grasp of what is going on, while keeping the syntax simple and familiar. With functions like `Info`, `Warn`, `Error`, and `Debug`, Yap makes it easy to log for different purposes without clutter or complexity.

## ðŸ›  Roadmap

- Severity colors & styles customization
- JSON log output
- Custom formatters
- File logging
